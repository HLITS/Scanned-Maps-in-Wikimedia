# Scanned Maps in Wikimedia Commons and Wikidata

## Project Background
  Harvard Library has selected a subset of its maps collection to serve as a scalable prototype for libraries to share larger collections and different types of digital content with Wikimedia. The chosen collection includes historic paper map digital images that support the development of a model workflow for integrating linked data descriptions that feature historically significant geospatial elements with Wikimedia. Harvard will work with Wikimedia to expose digital image content on the web, with relevant metadata and connections to Wikidata entities, and explore enhancement of converted legacy descriptions in the sandbox editing environment as well as native Wikidata tools.

## List of Project Components

### Wikimedia Project Management Template

Contains project management steps and a lifecycle diagram for how Harvard librarians working on Wikimedia projects understand the platform's utility for other librarians, but also Harvard faculty and students during remote teaching. 

For files and documentation from the Harvard Library American Currency Wikimedia Commons project mentioned here, see its [GitLab page](https://gitlab.com/hldsi/WikiMedia_Currency_Collection/-/tree/master/irmafrat).

### Chinese Cities Map Project Files

The pilot dataset for this project was identified by Harvard Map Collection staff: approximately 350 maps, including a series-level collection, of Chinese cities ranging from the 17th to 20th centuries. Here you will find the files and documentation associated with loading these maps into Wikidata, and then Wikimedia Commons.
