# Pattypan for Scanned Maps project

We used Pattypan in conjunction with Google Sheets.

1. Extract Wikidata QIDs, put them in column A, and use the Google Sheets add-on to populate subsequent columns with data needed for Commons template.
2. Remediate information and copy it to the spreadsheet generated by Pattypan.
3. Use Pattypan to upload.
