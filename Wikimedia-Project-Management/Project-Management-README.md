# Wikimedia for Faculty, Students, and Us

## Background

_NB: “Wikimedia” will be used here as shorthand to refer to any of the projects administered by the Wikimedia Foundation. All are mainly edited by volunteers, despite their official oversight and server space. The three most common for Harvard Library purposes are [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) (encyclopedic articles), [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) (high-quality reusable images), and [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) (structured Linked Open Data)._

Wikimedia projects are appropriate for a wide variety of projects involving collaborative digital writing assignments, digital collections curation, data analysis, and any combination of these, as well as others not yet foreseen. As we enter a second phase of Harvard Library Remote Work for the 2020-21 academic year, Wikimedia will be a necessary open platform for students, faculty, and information professionals to use for online teaching and learning. Three use cases that have already been requested by students and faculty will be highlighted in this document, along with examples, workflows, and documentation.

1. Editing Wikipedia by adding information to articles missing information or citations, adding Harvard Library materials as external links for well-developed articles, creating new articles when appropriate, etc. — Case Study: [Black Lives Matter Edit-a-thon](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iewWl0CHoZLBAMBR26MntejwrQVkSf0D-9bj-AEwAuQ/edit?usp=sharing)
2. Importing Harvard Library Digital Collections objects into Wikimedia Commons for increased Web visibility and image annotation — Case Study: [American Currency Collection](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:American_Currency_Collection)
3. Performing data analysis and visualizations on Wikidata items 
  * Current Events — Case Study: [COVID-19 topic graphs](https://scholia.toolforge.org/topic/Q84263196)
  * Diversity, Inclusion, Belonging, and Anti-Racism — Case Study: [Representation of African Archaeology Sites across Wikimedia](https://w.wiki/XXB)
  * Optionally also adding Harvard Library records (even if not digitized) to Wikidata for analysis — Case Study: [Cartographic Notebooks of Erwin Raisz](https://tabernacle.toolforge.org/#/tab/sparql/SELECT%20%3Fnotebook%20%3Fstarted%20%3FnotebookLabel%20%3Fsubject%20%3FsubjectLabel%20%3Fabout%20%3FaboutLabel%20%3Fproduct%20%3FproductLabel%20WHERE%20%7B%0A%3Fnotebook%20wdt%3AP361%20wd%3AQ60347105%3B%20wdt%3AP180%20%3Fsubject%3B%20wdt%3AP571%20%3Fstarted.%20OPTIONAL%20%7B%3Fnotebook%20wdt%3AP921%20%3Fabout%7D.%0AOPTIONAL%20%7B%3Fproduct%20wdt%3AP1479%20%3Fnotebook.%7D%0A%20%20SERVICE%20wikibase%3Alabel%20%7B%20bd%3AserviceParam%20wikibase%3Alanguage%20%22%5BAUTO_LANGUAGE%5D%2Cen%22.%20%7D%0A%7D%0AORDER%20BY%20ASC(%3FnotebookLabel)%20/P31%3BP361%3BP180%3BP921%3BP571%3BP1537)
  * Digital Humanities — Case Study: [Map from the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft data](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=59369467c3a24fbe8c9fbe1a31bd707f)
  * Climate Change — Case Study: [Multilingual Structured Climate Research Data in Wikidata](https://zenodo.org/record/3994266#.X1KMRud7lPY)

While these projects may look and sound very different from one another, they actually have more in common than not. When it comes to devising and managing projects, they have largely similar workflows and steps, as agreed and documented by the Wikimedia Remote Work Project Team.
